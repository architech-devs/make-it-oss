## Git Commit Message Convention

> This is adapted from [Angular's commit convention](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog/tree/master/packages/conventional-changelog-angular).

### TL;DR:

Messages must be matched by the following regex:

```js
/^(revert: )?(feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|perf|test|workflow|build|ci|chore|types|wip)(\(.+\))?: .{1,72}/;
```

### Full Message Format

A commit message consists of a **header**, **body** and **footer**. The header has a **type**, **scope** and **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:`, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body, it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However, if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

**Available types:**
- **feat**: A new feature for the user
- **fix**: A bug fix for the user
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **chore**: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- **types**: Changes to TypeScript type definitions

### Scope

The scope could be anything specifying the place of the commit change. For Make-It-OSS, suggested scopes include:

- **client**: Changes to the frontend React application
- **server**: Changes to the backend Express application
- **api**: Changes to API endpoints or contracts
- **ui**: Changes to UI components or styling
- **docs**: Changes to documentation
- **github**: Changes to GitHub integration
- **gemini**: Changes to Gemini AI integration
- **config**: Changes to configuration files
- **deps**: Changes to dependencies

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize the first letter
- no dot (.) at the end
- maximum 72 characters

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Examples

```
feat(client): add repository URL validation

Add client-side validation for GitHub repository URLs to provide
immediate feedback to users before making API requests.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(server): handle rate limiting for GitHub API

Implement proper error handling and retry logic for GitHub API
rate limiting to improve reliability.

Fixes #456
```

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions

Add missing environment variable setup steps and clarify
the development workflow.
```

```
refactor(api): extract GitHub service logic

Move GitHub API integration logic to a dedicated service
module for better code organization and testability.
```

```
BREAKING CHANGE: change API response format

The /api/project/scan endpoint now returns a different response
structure. Update your client code accordingly.

Before:
```json
{
  "data": { ... }
}
```

After:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "summary": "...",
  "componentMapping": "..."
}
```
